# Documentation Summarizer
A Proof of Concept for an NLP-based web app that could be used to parse highly-technical product documentation to provide summaries to users.

Note: The majority of the Web Application code is contained in the "WebAppCode" folder. To run it, you need the Python modules Flask and virtualenv (both available on pip). After installation, set the development environment to MainApp.py and enter flask run in terminal to launch the web app.
